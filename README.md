## üèó Structure

The base structure of this template is the same as Sapper's [default template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template/). These are some of the new things you'll find here:

### src/routes/blog

This is the home of your blog. The most important files in here are:

- `_posts.js`: this module contains the logic for loading and parsing your markdown posts.
- `[slug].svelte`: this is the template of your blog post page.
- `index.svelte`: this is the template of your article list page.

### src/routes/blog/posts

This is where your markdown posts live in. All `.md` files in this directory are treated as blog posts and parsed automatically by the `_posts.js` module.

- The markdown file name becomes the post slug. For example `hello-world.md` becomes `http://localhost:3000/blog/hello-world`.
- Everything between the start of the post and the `<!-- more -->` tag becomes the article's "excerpt".
- Frontmatter properties supported are `title` and `date`.

### src/routes/projects

This is your projects page. You can add your projects info to Projects array in projects.js file:

```js
export const Projects = [
  {
    name: "project_name",
    description: "project_description",
    imageUrl: "project_image_url",
    code: "project_source_code",
    live: "project_live_version",
    technologies: "project_stack"
  },
]  
```
